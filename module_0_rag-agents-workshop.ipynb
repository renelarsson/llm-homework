Open a terminal and run:\\n   ```\\n   sudo emerge app-emulation/docker\\n   ```\\n\\n2. **Start the Docker service**: You’ll need to start the Docker service to begin using it. You can do this with:\\n   ```\\n   sudo rc-service docker start\\n   ```\\n\\n3. **Add your user to the Docker group**: This will allow you to run Docker commands without `sudo`. Run the following command:\\n   ```\\n   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER\\n   ```\\n   Log out and back in for this change to take effect.\\n\\n4. **Test your installation**: You can verify that Docker is running by executing:\\n   ```\\n   docker run hello-world\\n   ```\\n\\nIf Docker is installed correctly, this command will download a test image and run it, displaying a confirmation message.\\n\\nMake sure your system is up to date and review the Gentoo Docker wiki page for any additional configurations specific to your setup.\",\"source\": \"OWN_KNOWLEDGE\"\n",

Here are some general tips:\\n\\n1. **Understand the Basics**: Ensure you have a solid understanding of Docker and Terraform fundamentals. Go through the official documentation to grasp core concepts.\\n\\n2. **Hands-On Practice**: Engage in hands-on practice by setting up your Docker environment and creating simple Terraform scripts. Experiment with deploying applications using Docker containers and managing infrastructure with Terraform.\\n\\n3. **Follow Best Practices**: Follow best practices related to Docker image creation, container management, and Terraform infrastructure design. This includes organizing your files appropriately and understanding how to manage dependencies.\\n\\n4. **Troubleshooting Skills**: Develop troubleshooting skills by familiarizing yourself with common errors and how to resolve them, as seen with issues like missing modules or configuration errors. \\n\\n5. **Utilize Learning Resources**: Refer to additional learning materials, tutorials, and forums for community support. Leverage online courses or video tutorials specific to Docker and Terraform.\\n\\n6. **Collaborate and Seek Help**: Don't hesitate to collaborate with fellow students or seek help from your instructor or online communities if you run into challenges. \\n\\n7. **Review and Reflect**: After completing assignments or hands-on projects, take time to review what you learned and reflect on how you can apply that knowledge in practical scenarios.\\n\\nBy integrating these strategies into your study routine and practical work, you can enhance your chances of success in Module 1.\",\n",

            "answer: After you create a GitHub account, you should clone the course repo to your local machine using the process outlined in this video: Git for Everybody: How to Clone a Repository from GitHub\n",
            "Having this local repository on your computer will make it easy for you to access the instructors’ code and make pull requests (if you want to add your own notes or make changes to the course content).\n",
            "You will probably also create your own repositories that host your notes, versions of your file, to do this. Here is a great tutorial that shows you how to do this: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/setting-up-a-repository\n",
            "Remember to ignore large database, .csv, and .gz files, and other files that should not be saved to a repository. Use .gitignore for this: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes/gitignore NEVER store passwords or keys in a git repo (even if that repo is set to private).\n",

            "question: Is it possible to use tool “X” instead of the one tool you use in the course?\n",
            "answer: Yes, this applies if you want to use Airflow or Prefect instead of Mage, AWS or Snowflake instead of GCP products or Tableau instead of Metabase or Google data studio.\n",
            "The course covers 2 alternative data stacks, one using GCP and one using local installation of everything. You can use one of them or use your tool of choice.\n",
            "Should you consider it instead of the one tool you use? That we can’t support you if you choose to use a different stack, also you would need to explain the different choices of tool for the peer review of your capstone project.\n",

            "question: Certificate - Can I follow the course in a self-paced mode and get a certificate?\n",
            "answer: No, you can only get a certificate if you finish the course with a “live” cohort. We don't award certificates for the self-paced mode. The reason is you need to peer-review capstone(s) after submitting a project. You can only peer-review projects at the time the course is running.\n",
