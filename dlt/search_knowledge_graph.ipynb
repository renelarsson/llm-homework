    "1. App analogy \n",
    "* `search_knowledge_graph.ipynb` acts like the app’s user interface, where you interact, ask questions, and see results.\n",
    "* `filesystem_pipeline.py` and `mount_cognee.py` are like the app’s backend program, working behind the scenes to gather, organize, and structure the data that powers the user interface.\n",
    "* `api_spec_ontology.owl` is like the app’s data model or schema. It sets the rules for how information is structured, connected, and understood by the backend, ensuring the data is organized in a meaningful and consistent way for the user interface to access and display.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Library analogy \n",
    "* `filesystem_pipeline.py` is like a librarian who goes out to collect books (API documentation) from different sources, organizes them, and puts them into a cataloged storage room (structured CSV files).\n",
    "* `mount_cognee.py` is like another librarian who takes those cataloged books, arranges them on the library shelves according to a special system (the ontology), and creates a map of the library (the knowledge graph) so you can find information easily.\n",
    "* `api_spec_ontology.owl` is like the library’s cataloging system or classification rules (such as Dewey Decimal or Library of Congress). It defines how books (knowledge) are organized, labeled, and related on the shelves, so you can find and connect information efficiently.\n",
    "* `search_knowledge_graph.ipynb` is the library visitor, using the map and the organized shelves to quickly find answers to your questions by searching through the library’s resources."
